# OLX Car Cover Scraper (Selenium Version)

This project automates the process of searching **Car Covers** on OLX using **Python + Selenium**.  
The script extracts listing details (title, price, location, and link) and saves them into a JSON file.  

If OLX blocks automated scraping (due to SSL/bot protection), the script **falls back to sample data** so you can still demonstrate file-saving functionality.
